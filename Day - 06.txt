process management
=====================
TM --> TL --> TM --> Senior --> Junior --> Frehser

TM --> 5 tasks for 5 TL

ls -l --> it creates a process and assign a process ID, executes the command in kernel --> get the o/p --> display on screen

ps ( Process strted by the current username)
whatever the task you give to linux first it will one PID then work on it,gives the results and complete the process

ps -ef (to see all the process)

UID          PID    PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
root           1       0  0 May02 ?        00:00:15 /usr/lib/systemd/systemd --switched-root --system --deserialize=32
root           2       0  0 May02 ?        00:00:00 [kthreadd]
root           3       2  0 May02 ?        00:00:00 [rcu_gp]
root           4       2  0 May02 ?        00:00:00 [rcu_par_gp]
root           5       2  0 May02 ?        00:00:00 [slub_flushwq]
root           6       2  0 May02 ?        00:00:00 [netns]
root           8       2  0 May02 ?        00:00:00 [kworker/0:0H-events_highpri]
root          10       2  0 May02 ?        00:00:00 [mm_percpu_wq]

PID and PPID (parent processing ID)

ps -ef | grep <process-name>

foreground and background process


sleep 10  (foregrounds which blocks the screen, we cant do anything)
sleep 10 &  (example runs background)

sleep 100 & ( which runs 100 seconds in the backend)
& to take process into background

kill PID --> request to terminate  (should not kill the parent which will be in the third column, kill the seond column id)
kill -9 PID  (like force kill using -9)

systemctl status nginx
ps -ef | grep nginx

we have application running --> PID

10 users --> 0.1% CPU 0.1% RAM
2000 users --> 10% CPU, 20% RAM
10 users 

top (to check whih process is cosuming more)

***top -p PID --> check the resources used by particular process

get the logs and kill process and restart services

Network management
===========================
how do you check open ports in linux

netstat -lntp

systemctl status <service-name>
ps -ef | grep service-name
netstat -lntp
top -p PID

3 tier architecture
===========================
desktop vs web application

resources usage more
hang
installation
upgrade
storage
compatability issues
no data security/backup
can't access everywhere
what if it crashes all data lost


Applications move to web - 1 tier -> 2 tier -> 3 tier

architecture is important

road side breakfast shop = 1 tier
==========================
single person --> less than 10

taking order, cooking the item, serving, payment collection

(one server for all)

hotel - 2 tier
=====================
cook --> prepares the item
owner --> counter --> issuing tokens

let's say 20 members

(seperate dabase server and application server)

restaurant - 3 tier
=====================
captain --> welcomes the customer
waiter --> takes the order
chef --> prepares the order
waiter --> garnish with cabbage, onion, lemon, keera, etc.
customer

Raw food items > Chef cooks them > Decorates them > Customer eats them

100 members

(Database server -> application server can access the data -> Handovers the data to web server ->
 web server decorates them with HTML,CSS AND JS -> Show to user

directly to chef
==================
1. security
2. queue management --> reduces taste of item
3. maintenance issues

select * from users where username = 'siva@joindevops.com' and password = 'siva123'

visual studio, putty, terraform, aws cli v2



Load Balance ========> Web Server/Front End =========> Application Server/Back End ========> Database

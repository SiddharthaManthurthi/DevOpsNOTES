1. Create repo either in organisation or directly
2. Clone repo in laptop
3. write something
4. git add ., git add <file-name>
5. git commit -m "message"
6. git push origin main
7. git clone url
7. git pull

git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email

Shell Scripting
===============
commands in a file and run it called scripting

if I run a command --> I have common sense, I can understand whether it is success or not...
shell is native in Linux. If you want any automation inside linux server, shell is the perfect choice.
python is useful when you are interacting with other/external systems.

write only in laptops
don't write in linux servers
only pull linux

95% thinking+design 5% coding

pseudo code -> no syntax, just assumption

if today is sunday, enjoy the holiday otherwise go to school

today=wednesday
if(today != sunday){                         (! means not equal to and { this for expression)
	print ("goto school")
}
else{
	print("take holiday, enjoy")
}

15

15/2 -> 1
if reminder is 0 -> even
otherwise odd

number=15
reminder=15%2
reminder=1

if(reminder == 0){
	print("even number")
}
else{
	print("odd number")
}

let x=1, y=0  ( Variables -->variables are like containers that holds something)

derive the formula

submit finally

DRY -> Dont repeat yourself (change in one place reflect everywhere you refer,easy to maintain,readable)

PERSON1=Suresh   (if we want to change name we can just update here example instead of ramesh we can add trump it will automatically adds this updated names in the conversation)
PERSON2=Ramesh

$VAR_NAME    --- ways to refer using the variable $ for denoting it as variable
${VAR_NAME}  --- ways to refer using flower brackets the variable ( If there is conversation between suresh and ramesh based on the variable reference it will dynamically take person names)


Special variables in shell
============================

we no need to define the variable, shell will provide to us  ( we can also run shell with the names called arguments)

Person1=$1
Person2=$2

sh 03-conversation.sh Suresh Ramesh ( the script will run with given names suresh and ramesh as 1 and 2)
args == parameters

$1=Suresh  ( $ is for special variable)
$2=Ramesh


$    --> for denoting it as variable
read -->for reading and assigning it in the terminal
read -s --> to not show what entering

I want a command to be executed and take the output into variable, how to do that?

VAR_NAME=$(command)  ->  (TIME_STAMP=$(date)it will give the ouput in the command when runned)
date+%s (for date in seconds)
(()) --> one for mathematical and another for command excution


Special variables means shell only creates them
=================
$1 $2 ... $N args passed to script
All variables passed to script: $@
Number of variables passed to script: $#
Script name: $0
Present which directory you are in: $PWD
Who is running this script: $USER
Home direcory of the user: $Home
PID of the script: $$
sleep 100 & -- to go background
Background process id: $!
Exit status of previous command: $?

$@ vs $*
=========
$@ treats args seperately
$* treats as single args

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

data types
==============
variables are holding data..

mobile number -> numbers
	integers -> -33,768 -> 33,768
	float -> 45.90
	decimanl -> long number
	complex -> 4+8i
names -> string
major? -> yes or no boolean
skills -> devops aws docker kubernetes -> list of skills
skills -> map or dictionary
	devops: 4 -> key -> value
	docker: 3
	kubernetes: 2
	
areane4 -> 5
speed round up -> 8.2km/sec -> 8km/sec
copied code

integer speed=8km/sec
integer speed=8.2km/sec

number
string

everything is string in shell

position/index in coding starts from 0

conditions
==========

if or when

if [ expression ]; then
	code here
fi

if [ expression ]; then
	code here
elif [ expression ]; then
	code here
else
	code here
fi


-gt --> greater than
-lt --> less than
-eq --> equal
-ne --> not equal

Dollar $ Why no $NUMBER here?

Left side → creating / assigning a variable

Right side → reading a value

$NUMBER=$1   # ❌ invalid
NUMBER=$1    # ✔️ create variable


EXIT code
==========
0-127

----$?  exit status of previous
0 means success
1-127 failure

nginx

dnf install nginx -y

if root user then success
otherwise failure

id -u (for getting id of the user)

root user id -> 0
other users -> greater than 0

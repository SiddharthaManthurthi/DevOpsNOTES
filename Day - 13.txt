Linus File Sytem Heirarchy  --( Availble in conepts section in my git)
===========================

cd / -> root if you give ls -l we can see all the heirarchyies

/bin ->   Essential user binaries/softwares/commands  (ex. which ls,cp ==ls is in bin)
/boot ->  OS booting process commands or files
/dev ->   devices ( everything in linux is file including keyboard,mouse,disk,USB etc.)
/etc ->   extra configuration. (configurations related to sytem or user installed packages are here)
/home ->  any user related directories are here (/home/<username>)
/lib ->   all required libraries are here
/media-> removable disks like USB,DVD,etc are mounted here automatically in desktop environments
/mnt->   used to mount extra disks in linux server are here for temp purpose
/opt->   optional ( when you install a software manually you do it here. eg. /opt/roboshop, /opt/tomcat)
/proc->  processor information (cat /proc/cpuinfo. /proc/meminfo) here info is related to kernal
/root->  root user home directory
/run->  running process information
/sbin-> essential root user binaries/softwares/commands
/srv->  service ( data related to the system like HTML directory, NFS directory, etc.)
/swap-> virtual RAM ( swap usage is more means syste, is under stress)
/sys->  kernal sub systems
/temp-> temporary directories in linux
/usr -> user related commands and libs are here
/var-> variable files, continously growing files are here

Hard Disk VS Network Disk
=========================
Hard disk near to computer ( so we create it in the same availabilty as server)
network disk any where in the internet like google drive, MS drive,S3, etc..

OS,DB always should be in HD, HD latency is less
normal files and objects are stored in network storages

at a time one HD can be mounted to only one computer
Nerwork storages can be attached to multiple computers

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to add extra disk to linux server
================================================
1. Create EBS volume
2. Attach to the instance (EBS Volume shoud in the same as EC2) ->Elastic Block Store->Volume->create->actions->Attch volumes (IT WILL NOT BE AUTOMACTIALLY ATTACHED IN LINUX )
3. verify if it is attached or not using command lsblk (lsblk -list block devices)
  a.nvme0n1   --> root disk -->used for OS default purpose
  b.nvme1n1   --> New disk ( but it is not ready yet) ->database data, imp files and configurations are stored here
4. create partition from the disk (this will create partition nvme1n1p1   )
  sudo parted /dev/nvme1n1 --script mklabel gpt mkpart primary 0% 100%
5. Create a Filesystem (XFS – Best for AWS) (to read zeros and show it to enduser readable format)
  sudo mkfs.xfs -f /dev/nvme1n1p1
=>df -hT  (what are mounted and to check storages) it will show types as xfs now
/var/ib/mqsql -> mysql data is stored here ( this location should be safe and backup)
/data         -> redis here

6. Create a Mount Directory
sudo mkdir -p /data (verify cd / -> ls -l you will data created but data from this should go to new disk)
7. Mount the Disk (Temporary Runtime Mount)
sudo mount /dev/nvme1n1p1 /data  (this means data will be stored in new disk nvme1n1p1 --> (verify by df -hT) (df -hT | grep data)
8.Get the Disk UUID (Permanent Identity)
sudo blkid /dev/nvme1n1p1 (you will get universal id) UUID="5345856e-1088-45b4-830e-8623ed7b2f5d"
9. Add Persistent Mount Entry (/etc/fstab)
we need to give the follow entry so that linux mounts -> 5345856e-1088-45b4-830e-8623ed7b2f5d   /data   xfs   defaults,nofail   0   2
10 Test the Configuration (No Reboot Needed)
=>sudo mount -a
If there are no errors, your fstab entry is correct.
Verify:
df -hT | grep data

How to expand existing Disk
==========================

=>Select Volume and Edit update the storage size
df -hT   ->Disk usage information and filters by file sytem type and space stats for everthin mounted -like total,used,free and type
lsblk    ->lists blocks information like disks and partitions with their sizes and mount points. df check whats full and lsblk see what's there
=> Extends in desk but not to file system or partion automatically
growpart /dev/nvme1n1 1  
xfs_growfs /data

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Memory usage/Management commands
================================
df -hT   ->Disk usage information and filters by file sytem type and space stats for everthin mounted -like total,used,free and type( checks directories mounted in hard disk and usage human readable format)
lsblk    ->lists blocks information like disks and partitions with their sizes and mount points. df check whats full and lsblk see what's there
free -m  ->Ram usage
top      -> present processes usage ( to check which program is consuming more like our task manager in windows)
htop     -> same top but human readable modern,interactive,colorful
ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -n 11 -> top 10 process by ram usage
ps aux --sort=-rss | head -n 11  -> Top 10 by memory in MB
du -sh * -> memory occupied by files and folders (to check deep in particular folder usage  for example cd /home -> cd /var -> du -sh * to check  var folder which is using more)


memory troubleshooting

swap --- a memory from HD as virtual RAM( system inactive and tabs ni swap ki pampisthundi system RAM ni free cheyaniki)

space checking
free -m ---machine readle farmat
free -h -- human readble

top --- used for memory monitoring
ps aux --sort -%mem | head -n 5 ------used for chcking top 5 memory consuming files
ps aux --sort -%cpu | head -n 5 ------used for chcking top 5 cpu consuming files

df -hT --- space of hard disk
du -sh * ----disk utilisation all file and foldrs of that path
du -sh / |sort -rh| head -n 20-------- top 20 disk utilisation

SDLC - 
=====
Software Development Life cycle

SDLC is a structured process used to design, develop, test, deploy, and maintain software efficiently and with high quality.

SDLC Phases
	
Requirement Analysis---	Understand what business needs
Planning ---------------Decide time, cost, team, risks
Design------------------Architecture, databases, and system workflows are defined
Development-------------Developers write code according to design documents
Testing	----------------Functional, integration, performance, and security testing
Deployment--------------Application Release to production
Maintenance-------------Bug fixes, enhancements, and performance tuning

A life cycle is the complete sequence of stages an entity goes through from creation to retirement
================================================================================================

Examples
Software Life Cycle: Requirement → Development → Maintenance → End of Life
Application Life Cycle: Design → Build → Deploy → Operate → Retire
Product Life Cycle: Introduction → Growth → Maturity → DeclineRequirements


(Example for construction we go to engineer)
Requirements ( space,bedroom,garden area)

Construction
Testing

Maintainance

Business and Technology -> reduce cost, stability, relaibility, increase business

Business Analyst

Requirements gathering

Design the system
Development
Testing
Deployment
Maintenance and Monitoring

Waterfall vs Agile vs Agile with DevOps
======================================

**Health Problem Example**

Yearly Health checks -> DEC 2026, max 50% chances -> Waterfall
Monthly Health checks -> 80% chances to prevent -> Agile
Apple watch/Daily checks ->  -> Continuous feedback--> Devops

**School example**

Stakeholders -> Who is part of the system

School -> Parents, Students, teachers, management, non teaching staff, investors, Government

Bank Project -> RBI, Government, Banking management, investors, bod, developers, testing, admin, devops and cloud, Support, reports, monitoring, etc.

50 years back model
=========
Final Exam

Parents -> Daily worry
Teachers -> 3 months
Students -> 60 days before

30-40% pass percentage


Process change -> Unit tests -> I, II, III, IV, V, Quarterly, half yearly, pre-final, final (Indigo FAILED example)

1 month
========
unit test - I
teachers -> must complete syllabus
students -> 1 week before

result -> 30% pass
parents -> 

unit test - II
=========
teachers -> must complete syllabus
students -> 2 weeks before

result -> 40% pass
parents teachers meeting
||
||
||
||
||
final
80-90% pass percentage

Daily slip tests
==============

200 exams -> 200 feedbacks
student -> DAY-1

99.9% pass

if you test a system 1 time, you get 10 defects
if you test a system 100 times, you get aleast 11 defects

DEV, QA, SIT, UAT, PERF, PRE-PROD, PROD

formula -> test the drink -> DEV
employees -> taste the drink, take feedback -> QA
friends and family members -> take feedback -> SIT
random group -> take feedback -> UAT 

Fassai -> take certification -> Client approval

release to public market -> PROD

1 **Waterfall methods**

--> just like waterfall (complete ga devlopment ayyaka next step testing  ki velledhi its waste lot of time and resources and still not get satistied results) once requirements are fixed we can't change <--

3 years for project to go prod-> 30cr clients

tech team -> 
6 months, 7 months
development
testing -> free, operations, build and release

testing -> 100 defects
developers -> free

100 defects -> analyse 40 invalid defects
working in DEV not working in PROD
ambassdor

last 1 year
 last 1 month deploy --> 100 defects
 20 invalid defects --> 

**process change -- Agile**
======================

 --> dintlo oka set of devlopment ayyaka testing ki move chese vallu better than waterfall but still not satistied <--

  Final product --> multiple modules --> sprint
  item --> 1 test --> 2 defects
  1000 test --> 3 defects
  
  login and signup --> sprint-1 --> 30 days

  orders
  menu
  payment
  shipping
  cart
  reviews
  employeesitem --> 1 test --> 2 defects

sprints -> 1 month
user -> login,signup, forgot password, otps...
1 month

15 days development, 15 days deployment and testing

developers -> from DAY-1
testing -> day -> 10

10 defects -> 3 invalid defects
end of the month -> show something

2 defects

sprint-II
=========
2 defects backlog + next module completion
DM, CSM -> what you did yesterday, what are you doing today, anything blocking you

**Process change --> Agile with DevOps**
======================================

Signup and Login

DAY-1 --> enter first name, enter last name, enter DOB

deploy on the same day, test on the same day
10 defects --> 1 invalid defect

success test cases -> right inputs, result fail -> failure
failure test cases -> failure input, result succes -> failure

+ve, -ve test cases
10 test cases -> less chances for invalid defects, 2 invalid defects
productivitiy, co-ordination, cooperation

build errors
functionality/development errors
deployment errors

IDBI -> 5% market share
100cr revenue
invest some amount on technology, reduce cost by moving from waterfall to devops, cloud


DevOps is the process of  building, deploying and testing the applications continuosly. basically if we can deploy and test the code on the same day we can get maximum feedback cycles to improve our product...
Ofcourse we use multiple tools to make this process smooth. continuos development, integration, deployment, delivery, testing, monitoring, application security etc part of devops

DevOps is the process of building, deploying and testing the code written by developer on the same day instead of doing after complete development.. we can acheive this using continous integration, continous deployment, continous delivery and continous testing. 
We can do faster releases with less defect using DevOps... basically automation mindset to get the best resultsDaily tests


--> DevOps Life Cycle is a continuous loop that automates planning, building, testing, deploying, operating, and improving software <--

Stage	
Plan----Identify business requirements and define tasks.
Code----Developers write and commit application code.
Build---Convert source code into executable packages.
Test----Automatically validate code quality and functionality.
Release-Approve the build for production deployment.
Deploy--Push application to production environment.
Operate----Run and manage the live application.
Monitor---Track performance, errors, and system health.
Feedback---Collect user and system feedback for improvement.


15th JULY -> AWS free tier is different
6 months -> 100$ credits + 100$ credits

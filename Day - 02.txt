Computer

Client server architecture
Authentication mechanisms
Firewall

Mobile vs Laptop vs Desktop vs Server == Washing Machine == AC == Computer

CPU
RAM
ROM ======> IP Enabled device
OS
Processor

what is computer?
==================
IP enabled device

laptop == mobile == server == chip == tv== Washing machine ==> computer (computing)
server ==> only to host applications

CPU, RAM, OS, HD, Processor --> IP enabled device

Windows vs Mac vs Linux
========================
Secure -> SSH
No graphics
	Low power
	Low bandwidth
	Low ram
	fast
heavy performance
free
run for years no need of restart
anti virus not required
opensource

hardware and software are tightly coupledn(MAC,UNIX)


Client Server architecture
===============================

Networking between computers

1. Network
2. Facebook application

serve --> lawyer serves to us, we are his client

facebook is in Linux server, if problem comes we need to login to server..

https://www.joindevops.com

Protocol: https
Port: 443
IP: DNS IP
Username and password --> authentication

SSH --> Secure shell
Port: 22
IP, Username and password/private-key

Firewall --> checks inbound and outbound traffic

inbound --> incoming traffic --> port number 22, 103.149.59.114
outbound --> outgoing traffic

incoming traffic -> inbound -> don't trust anyone
outgoing traffic -> outbound -> allow everyone to exit

NASA, DRDO -> check outbound traffic too

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

authentication
==================
1. what you know --> username password
2. what you have --> keys, tokens, authentication, rsa token
3. what you are --> fingerprint, retina, palm, face

Server == box == node

lock = public
key = private

key pairs --> public key and private key


1. create key pair
2. create firewall
3. import public key to aws account
4. create server and attach public key
5. attach firewall to server

Git Bash --> Mini Linux in windows
SSH client

browser --> http/https client
Linux Server --> SSH Server

192.165.89.1 (EXAMPLE IP)
0.0.0.0/0 -> every IP in the internet

compute or storage

protocol -> set of rules

http (EASY ACCESS FOR ALL) vs SSH(only employees/Linux)

git bash == SSH client Software == mini linux

C:\Users\siva -> back slash windows
/c/Users/siva -> linux format -> pwd

pwd -> present working directory

ssh-keygen -f daws-88s

Windows -> Hello == hello ==> case insensitive
Linux -> Hello != hello ==> case sensitive

ls -l -> files listing

54.80.53.154

ssh -i <private-key> user-name@IP
ssh -i <private-key> ec2-user@98.81.70.98


which protocol? which port? which server? username and pasword

http -> 80
https -> 443
SSH -> 22

ec2-user

ssh -i daws-88s ec2-user@54.80.53.154

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===========
Linux commands

OS --> Redhat, Ubuntu, centos, fedore, suse, oracle linux, amazon linux, debian, rocky linux, kali, solaris

Linux is os or not --> Linux is kernel

OS --> to interact with hardware

Kernal --> heart and brain of OS

Kernel + UI == OS

Redhat --> kernel + user interface ==> Redhat OS
Debian --> Linux kernel + UI ==> Debian

99.9% same all Linux distros/flavours

Redhat --> Open source --> code is free
Redhat enterprise RHEL --> support

RHEL = AWS Linux = Centos = Fedora = Rocky Linux = AlmaLinux

command <options> <inputs>

/home/ec2-user --> linux home directory
/c/users/siva --> windows home directory

cd --> change directory

cd .. --> one step back

------------------------------------------------------------

Typical real-world setup:

Your laptop → Windows

Your server → Linux (Ubuntu/Amazon Linux)

You connect using → SSH

Using a tool like:

PuTTY

MobaXterm

Git Bash
